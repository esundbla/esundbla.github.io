                  <h3>An independent study modeling the growth of basil through Machine Learning</h3>
                </hgroup>
                <pFor this project we collected environmental, physical and chronological data surrounding the growth of a sample of basil plants.  We used Arduino boards to collect humidity and temperature each hour.  Physical growth was approximated using an overhead camera capturing hourly images.  These images were then processed to generate a “green pixel count” that would represent growth of the basil.  After aggregating all sample data. We evaluated the growth through linear and polynomial regression models to identify any strong correlations between growth and temperature, humidity, or soil humidity.  This project was independent study conducted outside of the class room under the mentorship of Professor <Jian Feng>.  Code snippets and results can be found in the shared google <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PMsJeCxn3NbhfG9s1VEabhuyL1Ivp8pO">colab</a> for the project.</p>
